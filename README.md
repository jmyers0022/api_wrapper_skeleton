# Api Wrapper Gem Skeleton

A template for an API wrapper gem

## Installation

This isn't a gem you'd install. It's just a boilerplate/reference for wrapping a REST API.

## Specs

The specs are intentionally minimal since implementations will vary wildly. You should probably add some specs to cover your own cases.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.
